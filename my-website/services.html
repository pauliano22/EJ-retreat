                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>We personally visit each property we manage to conduct a comprehensive assessment. During this visit, we evaluate the property's condition, identify potential improvements, test all systems and amenities, and take detailed notes to ensure our team can operate everything efficiently. This hands-on approach allows us to spot opportunities and issues that would be missed in a standard virtual onboarding process.</p>

                        <p>As the property owner, you are responsible for covering the costs associated with handyman services, cleaners, and other service providers. These costs are not included in our management fee but rather are reimbursed directly through a saved payment method on file.</p>

                        <p>We work with a network of trusted local service providers, including cleaners, handymen, and maintenance professionals.
